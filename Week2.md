# Week 2

## Goals:
- Use Week 1 skills on TDD and debugging.
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Plans:
- Pair on Oyster Card challenge with a different person for three hours every day.
- Attend workshops on Code Reviews and Domain Model Diagramming.
- Daily Reading - makers suggested articles, blogs etc.
- Start to make progress on understanding doubles, mocks,

"DON'T GET IT PERFECT, JUST GET IT DONE"

Probably spent about 16 hours on this challenge. Started out by writing out a plan with classes i would need, methods and variables i would use, but as it got more complex and as more time went by without any code being written, I started to get anxious and looked at the code from about 2-3 past Makers' students.

I'm not confident that my Rspec actually tests what I want it to so will look for some coach feedback on this.

I made good progress with Twilio but was pretty exhausted by the time it came to writing out the code so I took it from ALM. I haven't been able to figure out how to write the Rspec for that method (place_order) so will ask a coach about this as well.

Feature tests work!! and it was exciting to get the text message :)
